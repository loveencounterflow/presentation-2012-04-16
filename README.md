# Presentation slides for Monday, April 16th, 2012

These are the slides for a presentation i will give on Monday, April 16th, 2012 in the
[Vetomat](http://wp.vetomat.net), Berlin, Germany, around 20:00.

Never mind the styling; content is more important. I do hope to get around to makethe styling more
appealing.

Although the slides are in English, i probably will talk German. Estimated duration is not less than an
hour.

There is a certain chance a cheap but usually very good dish will be orderable after the show. There's also
beer available and smoking is allowed on the premises, so i don't see any reason why anyone would not like
to attend this night.
